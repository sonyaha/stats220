# stats220
### This is my repo for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**
1. I am undertaking a degree in biology
   * In particular, I am interested in [developmental biology](https://veteriankey.com/gastrulation/)

2. I am taking STATS 220 because knowing how to handle data in R can be useful for biology
   * I've taken [BIOSCI 220](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/BIOSCI/220/1213) before, but I think I left feeling more confused than confident about statistics and coding
  
3. I am interested in learning about how to do more things in R
